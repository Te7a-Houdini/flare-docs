SMS notifications are sent through [Nexmo](https://www.nexmo.com/). You'll need an API key & API secret, which you can get by creating an account.
                                                                    
You can configure SMS notifications on the [account](/docs/configuring-notifications#on-the-account-level), [team](/docs/configuring-notifications#on-the-team-level) and [project](/docs/configuring-notifications#on-the-project-level) level. 

After having set up SMS notifications, you can send a test SMS by clicking "Send test notification".
