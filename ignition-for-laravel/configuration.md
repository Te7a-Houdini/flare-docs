In the `ignition` config file you can tweak the way the Ignition error page behaves and looks like.  

## Setting your editor

On a typical error screen paths to source file names are displayed. Next to the file name is a pencil icon. Clicking the pencil icon will open that file in your editor of choice. You can configure that editor in the `editor` key of the `ignition` config file. 

You can choose between `phpstorm`, `vscode`, `sublime` and `atom`.

## Theme support

You can configure a theme in the `theme` key of the `ignition` config file. Out of the box there are two beautiful themes supported.

`light`
