You can configure [Slack](https://slack.com) notifications on the [account](/docs/configuring-notifications#on-the-account-level), [team](/docs/configuring-notifications#on-the-team-level) and [project](/docs/configuring-notifications#on-the-project-level) level. 

After you've connected your Flare account to Slack, you can specify in which Slack channel the Flare notifications should be sent. When you specified a channel you can send a test message by clicking "Send test notification".
