[Our Ignition package](https://github.com/facade/ignition) offers you a beautiful, customizable error screen. 
It also allows you to share your errors to Flare publicly. If configured with a valid Flare API key, it will send errors to a project in your Flare account.

When sharing an error publicly, you can specify which pieces of information you want to include in the share.

When you've [added a solution](/docs/solutions/adding-custom-solutions) to your error, the error screen can display the solution and can even run it.
