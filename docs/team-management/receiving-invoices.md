We can mail your invoice monthly. By default, we'll send it to the owner of the account. On the "Invoices" screen of a team, you can customize this. At the "Invoice Delivery" section you can specify to which email addresses we should send invoices.

Of course, you can also download any of the invoices we previously sent.
