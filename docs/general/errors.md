Whenever an error gets reported by your application, we show it on the projects page. If you want to know more about the error, click on it to see [more details about the last occurrence](/docs/general/sharing-error-occurrences).

## Filtering errors

On the list of error of a project, you can search for errors. By default, we only show unresolved and unsnoozed errors. To search on error message, exception name, or url just start typing.

To search on a class only prefix your query with `class:`

You can use these prefixes to search on a specific attribute of an error. Additionally you can use `is:*` filters to query by error status.

-   `class`
-   `message`
-   `file`
-   `first_seen_at`
-   `last_seen_at`
-   `resolved_at`

-   `is:resolved`
-   `is:unresolved`
-   `is:snoozed`
-   `is:unsnoozed`
-   `is:recent`

## Resolving errors

You can resolve an error to inform anybody working on a project that the problem has been fixed.

## Snoozing errors

If you don't want to get notified about new occurrences coming in you can snooze the error.

## Deleting errors

Should any of the occurrences of your error contain sensitive data, you can delete the error by clicking "Delete" on the top left corner.

After confirming the deletion, we will delete the error and all of its occurrences from our systems. This action cannot be reversed.
