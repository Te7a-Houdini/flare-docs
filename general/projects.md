Projects hold all reported exceptions of an application. You can create a new project with the "Add project" button on the "Projects" screen of your account.

After a project has been created, installation instructions and an API key will be displayed.

You can ensure Flare has been installed correctly with the `flare:test` command.

```txt
php artisan flare:test
